# Biodiversity in National Parks
---
## Project Objectives:
- Complete a project to add to your portfolio
- Use Jupyter Notebook to communicate findings
- Run an analysis on a set of data
- Become familiar with data analysis workflow

For this project, you will interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.

You will perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, you will analyze, clean up, and plot data as well as pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.

After you perform your analysis, you will share your findings about the National Park Service.


## Project Tasks
1. Project Scoping
	- Properly scoping your project will greatly benefit you; scoping creates structure while requiring you to think through your entire project before you begin. You should start with stating the goals for your project, then gathering the data, and considering the analytical steps required. A proper project scope can be a great road map for your project, but keep in mind that some down-stream tasks may become dead ends which will require adjustment to the scope.

2. Load the Data
	- You have been given two CSV files:
		- `species_info.csv` - contains data about different species and their conservation status
		- `observations.csv` - holds recorded sightings of different species at several national parks for the past 7 days.

3. Explore and Explain Data
	- Once you have your data, it’s a good idea to get acquainted with it.
	  You should show some summary statistics and visually examine your data.
	  Don’t forget to write out some insights that you have gained along with
 	  your analysis.

4. Conclusions
	- Finally we can wrap up the project. You can write a conclusion about your process and findings
	- Main components that you will want to include:
		- What did you learn throughout the process?
		- Are the results what you expected?
		- What are the key findings and takeaways?
